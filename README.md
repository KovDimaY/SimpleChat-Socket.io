This is a simple chat with different rooms. The purpose of the project is to learn and practice how to use Socket.io and to have fun! This is my first project where I incorporated projects from GitHub to manage the process of development and also this is the first project where I use versions and releases. Just tried to make it a bit more organized and to feel like a real company development process. Hope you like it :D

The last deployed version is **SimpleChat v2.0.1**.
